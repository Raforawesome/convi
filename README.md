# Convi
A gui frontend for ffmpeg.

---
Convi is a simple GUI frontend for ffmpeg to quickly convert between file formats.  ~~You can also specify advanced options in the settings~~ (soonâ„¢).  This is designed as a lightweight and quick tool so you don't have to google "{format} to {format2} converter" every time you need to convert a file.  This means it won't go into advanced functionality like complex transcodes.

### Requirements
Depends on ffmpeg being installed and in path.
